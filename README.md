# FootballScoringSystem
Football World Cup Score Board as simple library

I have taken consideration of below points:
- Protection of data to make it more secure using getters and setters pattern.
- Interface and abstract classes for complete abstraction details and specification via interface.
- Name of the period in each game (Quarter)
- Current game status and game period
- Different type of scoring points based on each quarter and points scored by home team and away team
